/*
    A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this 
    ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

    You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

    Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].
